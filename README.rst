Retrieve information about network interfaces and routes of Linux machine, as |ip|_ tool does.

*This is still work in progress.*

Linetface has similar purpose as netifaces_ but unlike netifaces_, it does not aim to be portable, and aims to get more detail. It tries to return the same data as JSON output of Linux standard |ip|_ tool, in form of Python data type which is convenient to be consumed by other Python applications.

Motivation
----------

I used to work in an IoT project, where one of the features is to discover Onvif-compliant IP cameras in local network. I used WSDiscovery_ and observed its failure in some uncommon cases: the presence of WireGuard or Docker interfaces. To workaround it, I have to limit WSDiscovery_ to scan only muticast-supporting interfaces. The netifaces_ library doesn't help determine which interfaces allow multicast. I have to use external ``ip -j a`` command and parse its JSON result the get the info I need. However, using ``ip`` command, I stumble upon another issue: If I deploy my app to an Alpine-based Docker container, the above command fails, because in original Alpine Linux, the ``ip`` command of ``iproute2`` is replaced with ``ip`` command of BusyBox_, which does not support generating JSON. The unsound solution is to always install iproute2_, but the best elegant is to have a library which returns the same result as |ip|_.

That is the reason I create Linetface.
